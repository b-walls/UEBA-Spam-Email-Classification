SpamDetection_BOW:
This file contains a random forest and xgboost model that was trained on a dataset from kaggle. 
Dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/code/mfaisalqureshi/email-spam-detection-98-accuracy/input

I implemented a NLP techniques to clean the emails and to help the model make significant predictions.

At the bottom of the file there is a function call where you can input your own spam/not spam emails and the model
will classify the email.

SpamDetection:

Machine Learning project for AI/ML internship.
Data used is provided by UC Irvine. Dataset can be found here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/94/spambase

ML model uses data of thousands of emails labeled spam or not spam to classify and predict if an email is spam.
