data_preparation.ipynb -

  File used for data preparation for use in spam classificaiton models. This file contains a portion of feature engineering, and all of the text cleaning (removing special characters, removing stop-words, lemmitization). Due to the time complexity of the tasks and the amount of semi-raw data this file is separate from the rest of the project. This also allows for easier data management and storage, making it ready for the model when training and testing.
